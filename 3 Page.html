			<div style="padding: 0px 5px 0px 5px">The gold and blue colors were inherited from the former Soviet flag which were the gold from the hammer and sickle and the cyan bar from the bottom of the flag. The pattern represents the art and cultural traditions of the old Khanate and the Kazakh people. The sky blue background symbolizes the peace, freedom, cultural, and ethnic unity of Kazakh people including the various Turkic people that make up the present-day population such as the Kazakhs, Tatars, Uyghurs, Uzbeks, as well as the significant Mongol and Russian peoples. The sun represents a source of life and energy. It is also a symbol of wealth and abundance; the sun's rays are a symbol of the steppe's grain which is the basis of abundance and prosperity.

People of different Kazakh tribes had the golden eagle on their flags for centuries. The eagle symbolizes the power of the state. For the modern nation of Kazakhstan the eagle is a symbol of independence, freedom and flight to the future.</div>

			<div style="padding: 0px 5px 0px 5px">The emblem is an image of a shanyrak , the upper dome-like portion of a yurt, against a sky blue background which irradiates (in the form of sun rays) uyks (supports) set off by wings of mythical horses, inspired by Tulpar which represent bravery. The circle shape of the Emblem is a symbol of life and eternity. The shanyrak symbolizes family well-being, peace and calmness.

A design very similar to the Kazakh shanyraq is used in the flag of neighboring Kyrgyzstan; it is known as tunduk in Kyrgyz.

The colour version of the national emblem of the Republic of Kazakhstan consists of two colours: gold and sky blue. The golden colour corresponds to the bright, clear future of the Kazakh people, and the blue sky colour is a symbol of aspiration for peace, consent, friendship and unity with all people.</div>
