		Healthcare in independent Kazakhstan
        After the collapse of the USSR, the health care system was decentralized in Kazakhstan, many functions from the Ministry of Health were transferred to the executive bodies of regions and cities of republican significance, regional and city health departments received a significant degree of independence. At the same time, the reform and optimization of the system of free universal health care was initiated, which continues to the present. In the 1990s, on the recommendation of foreign organizations from the United States, a large-scale optimization of medical institutions began throughout the republic, hundreds of medical institutions were closed, liquidated or privatized (sold into private hands).
